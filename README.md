# React Form with Redux

This application will use React and Redux to allow a user to add items to the Kochab snack table.

## Base Requirements

- Create a new React app with `create-react-app`
- Bring in `redux` and `react-redux`
- Set up your `store` and `Provider`
- Create an input form that allows the user to add a snack (as a string) to an array. 
  - This form will `dispatch` an `action` and run a `reducer`. This reducer needs to add this new item to an array of snack items.
- Display this list of snacks on the DOM with another component.

Remember to `connect` each component that needs access to the Redux Store and Reducers! 

```
export default connect()(ComponentClassName);
```

## Note

If it helps, start with everything in the `App` component.

The long-term goal is to move things to components, but the focus here is to dispatch actions, run a reducer, and get the updated state data onto the DOM.


## Style Mode

- Bring in Material UI. Style and layout the app using it. [https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/)

## Stretch Goals

- Break the above into components for the form and the display if you have not already done so.
- Add another input for the name of the person who provided the snack. Make sure this shows up on the DOM as well.
- Bring in `react-router-dom` for client side routing. Move the Form component into its own view/route. Move the listing display into another view/route.
